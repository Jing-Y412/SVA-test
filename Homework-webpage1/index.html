            Hello everyone, I am a handsome ragdoll cat, born on November 18, 2023, and now I am an energetic and active age! 🐾

            I have a pair of gray blue eyes, shining, like the stars in the night sky ✨. My personality is super outgoing, like to explore new things everywhere, every day to run around, climb high and jump low, just feel that the day is interesting! But don't look at me, I'm a super clingy little guy! Whether it's sitting in the host's arms, or gently rubbing his hand, I enjoy the feeling of attention 💙.

            Favorite thing? Playing with the host, of course! Whether it's chasing a cat-teasing stick or hiding in a cardboard box to play hide-and-seek, I love it! If you are willing to feed me some small snacks, then I will use the most lovely eyes to return you! ✨

            Meow, that's my self-introduction! Hope you like me! (=ↀωↀ=)
          </p>

            I also have a nickname "Evil Kitty". ꉂ ˋ ᗜ ˊ   Because I like to run around! And also likes to mess up the Jing's table! She has a lot of trinkets on the table. I want to play,too! When the Jing's friends come home to play, I also like to play tricks on them, such as hiding in the corner while they pass by to jump out and scare them! Their reactions were interesting. (The one on the left is a doodle drawn by the Jing's professor! I like it very much!)
            But I still have a good side, like I learned to shake hands! Every time Mommy would hold out a hand while feeding me a snack, she would only give it to me after I put my paw on it. I don't understand why, but she looks happy. All right, well, just play with her. Meooooow.
